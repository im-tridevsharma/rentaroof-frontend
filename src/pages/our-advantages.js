                Often, the touchiest part of a real estate negotiation and
                selection has to be the ability to notice the smallest of
                details and can make a big difference when it comes to signing a
                long-term agreement. An R-A-R agent will always be able to
                notice often the tiniest details to get you the right picture
                but also to get you a fair deal.

                In todays time the term middleman/broker is looked upon as
                something bad, sites that aim to deduct the Real estate agent
                from the equation. If you study these websites and read the real
                reviews you will surely find multiple hidden charges. With
                Rent-A-Roof you have no hidden charges or beforehand payment.
                The service fee will only be charged once the rent agreement has
                been signed and the keys are handed over.

                If you've ever rented a house, you've probably dedicated a full
                binder somewhere to the documents that were involved in the
                transaction. These probably include the written offer, the
                written and signed counteroffer/Rent agreement, the little
                details (like specific repairs) and what exactly was and was not
                included in the rent agreed. The paperwork can be tiresome. This
                is when a good real estate agent can save the day. Often, these
                offers and counteroffers are limited by a time frame and the
                odds of missing something drops substantially when you're
                working with someone who knows the paperwork inside and out.
